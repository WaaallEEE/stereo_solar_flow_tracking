# Flow tracking on NASA STEREO imagery of the solar wind

### Research project on flow tracking methods for mapping the solar wind from image series of the STEREO COR2 deep-exposure campaign 

The purpose of this project is to track plasma density structures carried away by the solar wind. The image is a sample of the image series pre-processed by Craig Deforest at SwRI: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aac8e3

The data are further processed, and remapped using polar remapping to unwrap the solar corona. The following image series is a typical input of the flow tracking algorithm that we are developping.

The practical goal is to track as many density structures to map their velocities, and derive coronal dynamics (speed, acceleration, etc...).
